Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is an efficient version control system that allows you to keep track of changes chronologically, making it easy to develop programs in case you want to rollback some faulty features. Further, it facilitates the collaboration process by allowing others to make changes without affecting the main version, so that collaborators can add their own features without interfering with previous versions.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science is particularly useful in analyzing large sums of data and extrapolating trends to inform future decisions. For instance, machine learning techniques are used to analyze tumors on the body and classify them as malignant or benign, which is useful in detecting certain types of cancer.
